if you have an error when you select your levels this is because you don't have the correct mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.jar installed 
to install it go into your project's java build path , delete the wrong mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.jar who is not compatible with your directory
in Libraries, click on Add External Jars...
go into C:\Users\"Your users Name"\.m2\repository\mysql\mysql-connector-java\5.1.39\ mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.jar <-- here
click on the .jar and it will be installer into your libraries

you should already have the .jar if you correctly import the base project
if not 
search it on google
